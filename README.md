## Analyze A/B Test Results

This project is to analyze A/B test which the problems provided by Udacity. I completed this project as part of Udacity Nanodegree Program in Data Analyst (https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Part I - Probability

This part focus to find probability from tables.

<a id='ab_test'></a>
#### Part II - A/B Test

This part I make some hypothesis and try to know is the hypothesis accepted or rejected.

<a id='regression'></a>
#### Part III - A regression approach

In this part, I see that the result in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression
